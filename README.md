## What Does This Mod Do?

[![Revolutionizes Minecraft building forever](_static/bdubs.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1wtKudHYFs&t=1731s)

This mod implements a feature asked for by legendary redstoner [@BDoubleO100](https://www.youtube.com/@bdoubleo)
to allow dripleaf blocks to be locked in bent positions—not just the unbent state—when getting
a redstone signal—thus revolutionizing Minecraft building forever.

### Planned Features

- Option to allow redstone signals to **trigger** different dripleaf states
- Configuration via modmenu
- Ports to all versions of the game with dripleaf (so 1.17+)
- Neoforge port

## Installation, Usage and Compatibility
For multiplayer, this mod only needs to be installed **server-side**, and, assuming no other mods
are installed on the server, will work for vanilla clients.
